This is a md file that contains details about this Repository.

The Repository is called "Assignments" which contains all the tasks undertaken during the course of Zuri Training from week 3 to week 5.

The Repo contains three branches aside the main branch. They are: Week 3, Week 4, Week 5.

Week 3 Branch contains the 2 tasks for week 3 which are a website with Registration, Login and Success pages styled with CSS.

The webiste was to be built with replit platform. It is not online but you can see the raw platform here: https://replit.com/@OluwadarasimiOd/RegistrationLoginSuccess

The second task for Week 3 is a mock up portfolio website which should include an about me section, services section, projects section and also another page which is to be a form for contacting me. Also it is not online but can be seen here: https://replit.com/@OluwadarasimiOd/Portfolio

Week 4 Task was a single task with two variants which was to recreate two designs namely Flexbox Layout and Grid Layout. Platform of use was also replit and we should cleverly link the two pages together using a button. You can see the final work here: https://replit.com/@OluwadarasimiOd/Layout-Task

Week 5 Task just involves us pushing all the week 3 to week 4 tasks to Git and GitHub. Originally it is week 5 but since week 5 is not really about HTML and CSS, I have decided to add a md file just detailing the instructions of the Week 5 task.
